/**
 * @brief In Lua RTOS each virtual file system is mounted into a logical file system,
 *        each of them mounted into a folder of the logical file system. This folder
 *        is known as the mount point.
 *
 *        For example, if support for SPIFFS and FAT file systems are enabled,
 *        SPIFFS can be mounted into the / folder, and the FAT can be mounted into
 *        the /sd folder.
 *
 *        A set of functions are provided to deal with logical (the used by the
 *        programmer) and physical paths (the used by Lua RTOS). For example:
 *
 *        Logical path    Physical path
 *        ------------    -------------
 *        /               /spiffs
 *        /a              /spiffs/a
 *        /sd             /fat
 *        /sd/a           /fat/a
