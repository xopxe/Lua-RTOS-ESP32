/*

 The stepper driver is controlled by an interrupt that triggers every 1 / STEPPER_HZ seconds.

 Clock signal is generated accessing the GPIO registers directly. PWM is not used because
 with PWM we cannot guarantee that a movement involving more than 1 stepper starts at the
 same time.

 For a stepper the movement is defined by:

 - Number of steps
 - Frequency (this defines the speed)

 For example:

    200 steps at 200 Hz = 1 step every 0.005 seconds
    200 steps at 100 Hz = 1 step every 0.01 seconds

 Due to that we have a resolution of 1 / STEPPER_HZ we can have an error when calculating the
 number of ticks we need to reach the stepper frequency. For example, if STEPPER_HZ = 1000000:

    base period = (1 / STEPPER_HZ) seconds = 0.00001 seconds
 	stepper frequency = 333 Hz
 	stepper period = (1 / 540) seconds = 0.00185 seconds
 	ticks = (stepper period) / (base period) = 185.185 ticks

 	We need 185.185 ticks for generate a clock pulse at 540 Hz, but we only can count 185 or 186
 	ticks. If we count 185 ticks we have an error of 0.185 ticks.

 The error is compensated in the interrupt handler. In the previous example every 6 ticks the
 interrupt handler increments 1 tick for compensate.
